      <h3>IAT333 Interaction Design Methods: Final Project</h3>
      <p>This project is a 13 week SFU course project where a group of five students partnered with a company "Impactraction" to design a technology solution that suggests improvements  for the company’s product or service. </p>

      <h4>Online Meeting with the Company we will work with</h4>
      <p>My team and I chose an Ontario based start-up company called Impactraction to design a technology solution to improve their company's problems. <br>
      We contacted the CEO, Ashraful Hasan, and held an online meeting to get to know each other and share the direction we hope to take this project with.</p>

      <h4>Research</h4>
      <p>We did farther research on the company itself and the service they provide. We broke down the company's mission, vision, and values and brainstormed possible topics to study for future design work. <br><br></p>

      <h4>Design Focus </h4>
      <p>We came up with our first draft of the design focus which our solution will focus on. The design focus was written after constructive feedback from our course and interviewing potential users of Impactraction. <br><br></p>

      <h4>Personas & User Journey Maps</h4>
      <p>In Week 4, we developed two personas and user journey maps portraying potential users of Impactraction who will be affected by our team's design solution.<br><br></p>

      <h4>Three Concepts</h4>
      <p>After farther research on Impactraction, potential users, and products already on the market, we came up with three potential concepts that we could pursue as our final design solution. <br><br></p>

      <h4>Participatory Workshop</h4>
      <p>In order to receive a constructive feedback on the three concepts, we held a participatory workshop with Ashraful from Impactraction and a potential user of Impactraction. We conducted activities to analyze how they relate to the concepts and what they find important when using services provided by Impactraction. <br><br></p>

      <h4>Storyboard</h4>
      <p>After the participatory workshop, we narrowed down our concepts to two and created storyboards for each concepts. <br><br></p>
