      <h3>IAT334 Interface Design: Final Project</h3>
      <p>For my school course "Interface Design", I worked with three other students to create a user interface prototype for bulk purchases of groceries among neighbors.</p>

      <h4>Week 1: Ideating the Application</h4>
      <p>My team and I brainstormed and came up with three ideas of the application's function. <br>
      We focused on the domain of shopping for all our ideas, which included virtual tour shopping, fitting room at home, and wholesale delivery.</p>

      <h4>Week 2: User Personas</h4>
      <p>After deciding on the idea that we will proceed with to be wholesale delivery, we developed two user personas that identifies potential users of this application.<br><br></p>

      <h4>Week 3: Grey Box Prototype</h4>
      <p>In Week 3, we designed the basic interface of the application as a grey box prototype, outlining the basic functionalities of the application. <br><br></p>

      <h4>Week 4: Style Guide</h4>
      <p>Style Guide for the project application was designed in Week 4, as my team and I settled with specific colors and fonts that will be used to give the application an identity.<br>
        Some aspects of the style guide and photos from web were applied to the grey box prototype.<br><br></p>
